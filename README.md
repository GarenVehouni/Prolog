This repository contains Prolog code created by Garen Vehouni for a class assignment. 
The Prolog code is designed to solve specific problems or demonstrate understanding of Prolog programming concepts.

Assign4.pl: Prolog code file containing the main implementation.
Assign4V2.pl: An alternative version of the Prolog code.
EmployeeData.csv: CSV file containing employee data used by the Prolog code.
.Assign4.pl.swp: Swap file generated by Vim editor.

Reading CSV File:
The code uses the csv library to read data from a CSV file specified by the Filename parameter.
The read data is stored in the Rows variable.

Processing Rows:
The process_rows/1 predicate is used to process each row in the CSV file.
The process_row/1 predicate is then called to store the data from each row as a Prolog rule.

Storing Data as Rules:
The process_row/1 predicate extracts data from a row and asserts it as a Prolog rule using the assert/1 predicate.

Employee Queries:
The code includes several predicates (e.g., is_seattle_employee3/1, is_senior_manager_in_IT3/1) to query specific information about employees based on various criteria.

Other Predicates:
The code contains additional predicates for tasks such as calculating years until retirement, checking specific criteria (e.g., age, ethnicity), and performing salary-related calculations.
